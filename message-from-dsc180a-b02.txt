Update for Quarter 2 Checkpoint:

At this time we have been working on fitting this labeler to work better with our data by 
fixing the buttons to have appropriate labels, removing the proximity tags, updating the 
instructions, loading in a group of audio files to be labeled rather than just one, and 
storing those labels in a local JSON file. At this time the buttons are fixed, proximity 
tags are removed, and we are capable of storing at least one label in a JSON file. The 
group of audio files is still a work in progress and we have decided to wait on the 
isntructions until we do further testing.
