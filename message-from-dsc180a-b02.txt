As a note to the grader, we have spent most of this quarter exploring different ways to label and as such did not write much code this quarter.
I know we did discuss this in our TA check, but I wanted to add this as an addition. This repository is a fork from the labeler we plan to edit into
a two dimensional labeler. Thus far we have only done some minor tests, but any changes we made are part of the commit "quarter 1 project" and are
currently commented out. They are also marked with another comment that says either "Added by B02" or "test print".
