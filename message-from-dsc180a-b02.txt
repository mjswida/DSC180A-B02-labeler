How to run labeler:

After cloning this repository, add any audio files to the json file in the code. Make sure to save the code. After that follow these steps:

1. In your terminal cd into the DSC180A-B02-labeler directory
2. Use this command in the terminal to start a local server: python3 -m http.server 8000
3. Open this link in your browser: http://localhost:8000/examples/#! 
4. If you hear someone whistling instead of the first audio file you added, either clear cache or open a new private/incognito window to see changes â†’ command(mac) or control(other) + shift + R

Assuming this all worked, you can now label your spectrogram and when you click "Submit and Load Next Recording" your labels will download from your browser as a json file and load the next audio file in from the json folder of the directory. Once you are out of recordings it will remain on the final recording.
